# Lab Class 5

This is a repository for 201's class 5 lab, completed Feb. 10, 2017. Instructions below:

Today in lab you will create a new GitHub repo, and create solutions to some little code problems.

Be sure to follow instructions carefully. Here are a couple of things to keep in mind:

- Place no function calls in your code, unless inside of another function. Everything should be run by hand from the console. This is to give you additional practice using the console and practice efficient app-switching processes.
- Create a new branch for each code problem, and merge each branch into master on GitHub (and then pull back into master on your laptop!) when the problem is completed. Do the problems in order. Don't forget to pull the updated master branch from GitHub into your local master branch each
- Although this is an individual lab assignment, do feel free to collaborate and work in pairs or groups.
